## First version
### Idea
- This application is the smart contract which can be deployed to pallet_contract on substrate.
- When you sign up, you have to register "real name", "job", "community which you are belong to" & etc.
- We can create a specific group but the group can have only 3 members. It is named "XXX".
- This group can be used by marking the information, for example blog, news, & any other informations which are on the internet.
- We can express the power of trust of the pepople.
